Basketball Club Danubius webpage  

I started this project mainly to learn AngularJS routing and some other features and technologies used for building SPAs. But as I advanced I decided to make it more meaningful and turn it into project for new web page for my dad who runs the club (school of basketball) Danubius from Novi Sad, Serbia. So if I finish it, it will be online for you to checkout it out.    

To run this app:  
1. go into danubius dir  
2. install dependencies :$ npm install  
3. then type :$ npm start  
4. open the browser and go to lockalhost:3000
